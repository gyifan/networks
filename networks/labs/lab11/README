In order to run the programs, the user need to run the script: setup.
This script compiles the java programs in the client and server folder and
generates the keys used for SSL.

Then the user can open two terminals one for client folder and one for server
folder. Run execute-java-ssl-server first and then execute-java-ssl-client.
