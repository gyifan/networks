The xxd myfile output matches the data that file-test created. The file-test 
creates a write only file called myfile. It also creates a buffer struct which
contains an int, a double, a short, and 80 char. file-test puts 123 in the
int, 1.1314926 in the double, 9 in the short, and "Ahoy there!" in the 80
char. Then it write the buffer struct three times repeatly to myfile. 

In the xxd myfile output, it clearly shows the these three repetitions. The
hex output matches the both the nubmer and acsii code. So the file-test and 
xxd output agree with each other.

myfile and input-file contain the same peice of information but in different 
format. In myfile, 123, 1.1314926, and 9 are coded in primitive type as int,
double, and short respectively. However, input-file coded these three numbers
as acsii code. The read-test program assumes the numbers will be in int, 
double and short format. So it converts the acsii coded number in input-file
to int, double, and short. This misinterpretation is caused by inconsistant
protocol.

(1.4)
No. Using C streams still has the same problem of different data types. It
would display different output for myfile and input-file.
