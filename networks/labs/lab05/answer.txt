Problem 1

select(), FD_ZERO(), and FD_SET() all work on a set of file descriptors. 
After a fd_set is initialized, the FD_ZERO() can clear the set. FD_SET()
and FD_CLR() respectively add and remove a given file descriptor from 
a set. FD_ISSET() tests to see if a file descriptor is part of the set.
select() allows a program to monitor multiple file descriptors, waiting
until one or more of the file descriptors become "ready".
